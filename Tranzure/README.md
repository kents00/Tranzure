### Step 1: Create the Folder Structure

1. **Open your Android project** in Android Studio.
2. **Navigate to the `app/src/main/java` directory** where your package is located.
3. **Right-click on your package name** (e.g., `com.example.myapp`) and select **New > Package** to create the following packages:

   - `model`
   - `view`
   - `controller`
   - `network`
   - `utils`

Your folder structure should look something like this:

```
app
└── src
    └── main
        └── java
            └── com
                └── example
                    └── myapp
                        ├── model
                        ├── view
                        ├── controller
                        ├── network
                        └── utils
```

### Step 2: Organize Your Code

Now that you have created the necessary folders, you can start organizing your code into these packages:

- **Model**: This package will contain your data classes and business logic. For example, you might have classes that represent your data entities or handle data operations.

- **View**: This package will contain your UI components, such as Activities, Fragments, and custom Views. You can also include XML layout files here if you want to keep them organized.

- **Controller**: This package will contain your controllers, which manage the interaction between the Model and the View. In Android, this could be your ViewModels (if using MVVM), or you could create classes that handle user input and update the UI accordingly.

- **Network**: This package will contain classes related to network operations, such as API clients, Retrofit interfaces, or any other networking code.

- **Utils**: This package will contain utility classes and helper functions that can be reused throughout your application.

### Step 3: Implementing MVC

Here's a brief overview of how you might implement the MVC pattern in your Android app:

1. **Model**: Create data classes and repository classes that handle data operations. For example:

   ```java
   // model/User.java
   public class User {
       private String name;
       private String email;

       // Constructor, getters, and setters
   }
   ```

2. **View**: Create your UI components. For example:

   ```java
   // view/MainActivity.java
   public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
       @Override
       protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
           super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
           setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
           // Initialize UI components
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Controller**: Create classes that handle the logic between the Model and View. For example:

   ```java
   // controller/UserController.java
   public class UserController {
       private User user;

       public UserController(User user) {
           this.user = user;
       }

       public void updateUser(String name, String email) {
           user.setName(name);
           user.setEmail(email);
           // Update the view if necessary
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Network**: Create classes for network operations. For example:

   ```java
   // network/ApiClient.java
   public class ApiClient {
       // Retrofit or other network client setup
   }
   ```

5. **Utils**: Create utility classes. For example:

   ```java
   // utils/NetworkUtils.java
   public class NetworkUtils {
       public static boolean isNetworkAvailable(Context context) {
           // Check network availability
       }
   }
   ```

### Step 4: Use Dependency Injection (Optional)

To further improve your architecture, consider using a dependency injection framework like Dagger or Hilt. This can help manage dependencies between your Model, View, and Controller more effectively.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully implement an MVC folder structure in your Android app. This organization will help you maintain a clean codebase and make it easier to manage your application as it grows.
